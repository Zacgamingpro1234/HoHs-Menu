# How To Install
This extension helps you set up some glitches with some utilities. To use first download the zip and extract it. Go to the extensions page or type **chrome://extensions** (should work on all chromium-based browsers). Next turn on developer options then click on Load Unpacked. Select the folder and done. Please note that this will only work on https://kdata1.com/2020/10/House_of_Hazards/ since it is the most bare bones site. Right now there aren't a lot of features so suggest as much as you can! (Actually don't im lazy to implement them lol)

## Small Security Notices (Highly Unlikely)
If you are not using the extension disable dev options since there is malware that impersonate a dev extension and steal your personal data! Also yes the extension is safe and only enables on https://kdata1.com/2020/10/House_of_Hazards/ (a bare bones hoh site)
