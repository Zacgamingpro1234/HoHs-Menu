# HoHs Menu
A mod menu to assist you in House Of Hazards Speedrunning. This extension helps you set up some glitches with some utilities. 

# Please note that the 2 extensions are currently incompatible with each other!
# How To Install (Universal)
First download the zip and extract it. Go to the extensions page or type **chrome://extensions** (should work on all chromium-based browsers). Next turn on developer options then click on Load Unpacked. Select the folder and done. Please note that this will **only work on** https://kdata1.com/2020/10/House_of_Hazards/ since it is the most bare bones site. Right now there aren't a lot of features so suggest as much as you can! (Actually don't im lazy to implement them lol)

# How To Install (Using .Reg and .crx Files, Fixes the issue below)
This method only works for **Edge** and **Chrome!** First Download the HoHs_Menu.crx file and the EnableBypass.reg file. Open the reg file and accept/click on yes for all prompts. Now either restart your device or force close your browser. Next go to **chrome://extensions** and drag and drop the HoHs_Menu.crx file. If you want you can revert these changes by running UndoBypass.reg. If it still gives an error, enable dev mode, copy the id, edit the .reg file and paste that code instead of the previous one which should be ognicllbfgeeabdebbjckhehpikfgbgi.

## Small Security Notices (Highly Unlikely)
If you are not using the extension disable dev options since there is malware that impersonate a dev extension and steal your personal data! Also yes the extension is safe and only enables on https://kdata1.com/2020/10/House_of_Hazards/ (a bare bones hoh site)
